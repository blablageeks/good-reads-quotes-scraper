### Clone the repository

Now that we've successfully forked the repository and copied it into our account, we'll clone it, which essentially
creates a local copy of the project on your system. To clone a project locally, click the code button (red) followed by
the clipboard icon button (yellow). This step copies the repository link, which will be used to clone the project
locally.

Now clone the forked repository into your system. Navigate to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click
the code button, and then choose the copy to clipboard icon.

Now, open your terminal and run the following git command:
```shell
git clone `the-url-` # just paste using Ctrl+v to paste the url
# for example: git clone https://github.com/denisakp/quotes-scraping-tool.git
```

Then you move into the project directory  by running:
```shell
cd your-project-name

### Create a Git branch for your contribution

To create a git branch, run the following branch (make sure you run the previous command, and you're inside the project
folder):
```shell
git checkout -b your-branch-name

> This command will stage changes for the next commit

Now commit those changes using the `git commit` command:
```shell
git commit -m "added new feature"
# The commit message shown here is an example. You should include an informative statement that describes what your feature is about.
```

> Replace your-branch-name with the name of the branch you created earlier
